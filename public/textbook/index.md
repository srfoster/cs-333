# CS333: Data Structures and Algorithms I

Welcome to CS333! This course explores fundamental data structures and algorithms that are essential for efficient problem-solving in computer science.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive study of algorithm design and analysis, covering essential data structures, algorithmic paradigms, and computational complexity theory. Through core exam questions across three chapters, students will master the mathematical foundations of algorithm analysis, develop proficiency with fundamental data structures, and learn to apply key algorithmic strategies to solve complex computational problems.

The curriculum progresses from mathematical analysis techniques (Big-O notation, recurrence relations) through advanced graph algorithms to key algorithmic paradigms including greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, network flow, and NP-completeness theory. Students will learn both the theoretical frameworks for analyzing algorithmic efficiency and the practical skills needed to implement and optimize real-world algorithms.
