Topics to add somewhere:

Best/Average/Worst Case Analysis - Distinguishing between different scenarios for the same algorithm

Amortized Analysis - Understanding average cost over a sequence of operations (e.g., dynamic array resizing)

Space-Time Tradeoffs - Understanding when to trade memory for speed or vice versa

Practical Complexity - Understanding constants and lower-order terms matter in practice (when is O(n log n) actually slower than O(n²) for small n?)

Master Theorem - For solving divide-and-conquer recurrences (you have recurrence relations but not the Master Theorem specifically)

Loop Invariants - Proving algorithm correctness

Comparing Algorithms Empirically - Actually measuring runtime vs theoretical analysis

Common Algorithm Patterns - Two pointers, sliding window, etc. and their complexities
