question: |
  Consider the function f(n) = 3n² + 5n + 10.
  
  (a) Is f(n) = O(n³)? Justify your answer.
  
  (b) Is f(n) = Ω(n)? Justify your answer.
  
  (c) Is f(n) = Θ(n²)? Justify your answer.
  
  (d) Explain the difference between Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notations.
answer: |
  (a) Yes, f(n) = O(n³). Big-O provides an upper bound. Since 3n² + 5n + 10 ≤ 18n³ for all n ≥ 1 (choosing c = 18, n₀ = 1), f(n) grows no faster than n³.
  
  (b) Yes, f(n) = Ω(n). Big-Omega provides a lower bound. Since 3n² + 5n + 10 ≥ 3n for all n ≥ 1 (choosing c = 3, n₀ = 1), f(n) grows at least as fast as n.
  
  (c) Yes, f(n) = Θ(n²). Big-Theta provides a tight bound (both upper and lower). We can show: c₁n² ≤ 3n² + 5n + 10 ≤ c₂n² for sufficiently large n. For example, with c₁ = 3, c₂ = 18, and n₀ = 1, both inequalities hold.
  
  (d) Big-O (O) describes an upper bound (worst-case growth rate). Big-Omega (Ω) describes a lower bound (best-case growth rate). Big-Theta (Θ) describes a tight bound, meaning the function grows at exactly that rate (both upper and lower bounds with the same growth rate).
