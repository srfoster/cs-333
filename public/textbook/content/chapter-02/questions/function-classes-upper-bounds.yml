question: |
  Determine tight upper bounds (Big-O) for the following functions and justify your answers:
  
  (a) f(n) = 5n³ + 2n² + 100n + 50
  
  (b) g(n) = 3 log₂(n) + 7 log₂(n²) + 4
  
  (c) h(n) = 2ⁿ + n³ + 100n²
  
  For each, identify the dominant term and explain why lower-order terms can be dropped.
answer: |
  (a) f(n) = O(n³)
  - Dominant term: 5n³ (highest degree polynomial term)
  - As n grows large, n³ grows much faster than n², n, or constants
  - For n ≥ 1, we can show 5n³ + 2n² + 100n + 50 ≤ 157n³, so Big-O is n³
  
  (b) g(n) = O(log n)
  - First simplify: 3 log₂(n) + 7 log₂(n²) + 4 = 3 log₂(n) + 14 log₂(n) + 4 = 17 log₂(n) + 4
  - Dominant term: 17 log₂(n)
  - Constants and lower-order terms (like the constant 4) are dropped in Big-O
  - For n ≥ 2, we have 17 log₂(n) + 4 ≤ 21 log₂(n), so Big-O is log n
  
  (c) h(n) = O(2ⁿ)
  - Dominant term: 2ⁿ (exponential growth)
  - Exponential functions grow faster than any polynomial
  - As n → ∞, 2ⁿ eventually dominates n³ and n²
  - For n ≥ 10, we have 2ⁿ + n³ + 100n² ≤ 3·2ⁿ, so Big-O is 2ⁿ
  
  **Key principle**: In Big-O analysis, we keep only the fastest-growing term because it dominates the runtime for large n. The hierarchy is: constants < logarithmic < polynomial < exponential.
