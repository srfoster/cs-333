question: |
  **Compare and contrast binary search tree structures: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) vs AVL Trees**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why self-balancing trees were developed and their significance in computer science. Explain the fundamental trade-off between simplicity and guaranteed performance.
  
  **Level 1** For each tree type (BST and AVL):
  - Describe the defining property or invariant
  - Explain the balancing mechanism (if any)
  - Provide a simple example showing insertion and any rebalancing that occurs
  - Step through the differences with concrete examples
  
  **Level 2** Implement insertion for AVL Trees in a language of your choice, showing how balancing is maintained.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze and compare:
  - Height guarantees and how they affect lookup performance
  - Insertion/deletion cost trade-offs (number of rotations required)
  - When to choose each tree type based on workload characteristics (read-heavy vs write-heavy)
  - Real-world applications where each is used
answer: |
  **Defining Properties:**
  - **BST**: Left subtree < node < right subtree. No balancing guarantee.
  - **AVL**: BST + strict balance: |height(left) - height(right)| ≤ 1 for every node
  
  **Balancing Mechanisms:**
  - **BST**: None - can degrade to O(n) height (linked list)
  - **AVL**: Single and double rotations when balance factor exceeds ±1
  
  **Height Guarantees:**
  - **BST**: O(n) worst case, O(log n) average case
  - **AVL**: Height ≤ 1.44 log n (strictest balance → fastest lookups)
  
  **Performance Trade-offs:**
  - **AVL**: Best for read-heavy workloads - strict balance means fastest lookups but more rotations on writes (up to O(log n) rotations per insert/delete)
  - **BST**: Only use when data is known to be random or for educational purposes
  
  **Real-World Uses:**
  - **AVL**: In-memory databases, dictionaries where lookup speed dominates
  - **BST**: Teaching tool to understand tree concepts before adding balancing complexity
