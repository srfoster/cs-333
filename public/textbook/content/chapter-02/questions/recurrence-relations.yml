question: "The runtime of an algorithm is defined by T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n, with T(1) = 1. Solve this recurrence using a recursion tree and give a tight Θ bound."
answer: "Using the recursion tree method: Level 0: n work. Level 1: 2(n/2) = n work. Level 2: 4(n/4) = n work. The tree has log₂(n) levels (each divides input by 2). Total work = n × log₂(n) = Θ(n log n). This also matches the Master Theorem case 2 where a=2, b=2, f(n)=n, and f(n) = Θ(n^(log₂2)) = Θ(n)."
