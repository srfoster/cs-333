question: |
  **Implement algorithms to find minimum spanning trees (MSTs) in weighted graphs.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why minimum spanning trees are important and what problems they solve.
  
  **Level 1** For sample graphs, demonstrate both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms. Give pseudocode for both approaches.
  
  **Level 2** Implement both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the time complexity of both algorithms. Explain why the greedy approach works (cut property) and compare when to use each algorithm.
answer: |
  **MST Definition:**
  A subset of edges that connects all vertices with minimum total weight and no cycles. Has exactly |V|-1 edges.
  
  **Two Algorithms:**
  - **Prim's**: Grows single tree from start vertex, always adding minimum-weight edge crossing the cut. Uses priority queue. O((V+E) log V)
  - **Kruskal's**: Processes edges by weight, adds edge if it doesn't create cycle. Uses union-find. O(E log E)
  
  **Greedy Correctness (Cut Property):**
  For any partition of vertices, the minimum-weight edge crossing the partition is in some MST. Both algorithms respect this: Prim's explicitly chooses minimum crossing edges, Kruskal's chooses minimum edges between components.
  
  **Applications:**
  Network design (minimize cable cost while connecting all nodes), clustering (MST edges identify natural clusters), approximation algorithms for TSP.
