question: |
  Consider an undirected weighted graph with vertices {A, B, C, D, E} and edges: A-B (4), A-C (3), B-C (2), B-D (5), C-D (4), C-E (6), D-E (1).
  
  (a) Define a minimum spanning tree (MST) and explain its properties. Why does removing any edge from an MST disconnect the graph?
  
  (b) Apply Prim's algorithm starting from vertex A. Show the edge selected at each step, the growing tree, and the final MST with its total weight.
  
  (c) Apply Kruskal's algorithm to the same graph. Show the sorted edge list and indicate which edges are added to the MST or rejected (and why). Track the union-find operations.
  
  (d) Compare Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms: What are the key differences in their approach, data structures used, and time complexity? Why does Kruskal's greedy selection guarantee correctness (use the cut property)?
answer: |
  (a) MST definition and properties:
     A Minimum Spanning Tree is a subset of edges that:
     - Connects all vertices (spanning)
     - Forms a tree (acyclic, exactly |V|-1 edges)
     - Has minimum total edge weight among all spanning trees
     
     Why removing any edge disconnects: A tree has exactly one path between any pair of vertices. Removing edge (u,v) breaks the unique path between u and v, creating two separate components. Since trees have no cycles, there's no alternate path. An MST achieves minimal connectivity - it connects all vertices with minimum cost and zero redundancy.
  
  (b) Prim's algorithm from A:
     - Initialize: Tree = {A}, Available edges = {A-B(4), A-C(3)}
     - Step 1: Select A-C (3) - minimum crossing edge. Tree = {A,C}, Edges added = [A-C]
     - Step 2: Available = {A-B(4), C-B(2), C-D(4), C-E(6)}. Select C-B (2). Tree = {A,B,C}, Edges = [A-C, C-B]
     - Step 3: Available = {A-B(4), B-D(5), C-D(4), C-E(6)}. Select C-D (4). Tree = {A,B,C,D}, Edges = [A-C, C-B, C-D]
     - Step 4: Available = {B-D(5), C-E(6), D-E(1)}. Select D-E (1). Tree = {A,B,C,D,E}, Edges = [A-C, C-B, C-D, D-E]
     
     Final MST: A-C, C-B, C-D, D-E with total weight = 3+2+4+1 = 10
  
  (c) Kruskal's algorithm:
     - Sort edges: D-E(1), B-C(2), A-C(3), A-B(4), C-D(4), B-D(5), C-E(6)
     - Initialize union-find: {A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}
     
     - Process D-E(1): find(D)≠find(E), add to MST. Union: {A}, {B}, {C}, {D,E}. MST = [D-E]
     - Process B-C(2): find(B)≠find(C), add to MST. Union: {A}, {B,C}, {D,E}. MST = [D-E, B-C]
     - Process A-C(3): find(A)≠find(C), add to MST. Union: {A,B,C}, {D,E}. MST = [D-E, B-C, A-C]
     - Process A-B(4): find(A)=find(B) (both in {A,B,C}), REJECT - would create cycle
     - Process C-D(4): find(C)≠find(D), add to MST. Union: {A,B,C,D,E}. MST = [D-E, B-C, A-C, C-D]
     - Stop: Have 4 edges (|V|-1), MST complete
     
     Final MST: same edges as Prim's, total weight = 10
  
  (d) Comparison and correctness:
     
     **Approach differences:**
     - Prim's: Grows a single tree from a starting vertex, always selecting minimum edge crossing the cut between tree and non-tree vertices
     - Kruskal's: Builds a forest of trees, selecting globally minimum edges that don't create cycles, merging components
     
     **Data structures:**
     - Prim's: Priority queue for crossing edges, O((V+E) log V) with binary heap
     - Kruskal's: Sort edges O(E log E), union-find for cycle detection O(E α(V)), total O(E log E)
     
     **Kruskal's correctness (Cut Property):**
     The cut property states: For any cut (partition of vertices into two sets), the minimum-weight edge crossing the cut is in some MST. 
     
     When Kruskal's selects edge (u,v), u and v are in different components (different sides of a cut). This edge is the minimum-weight edge not yet considered, so it's the minimum crossing this cut. By the cut property, it's safe to include. By processing edges in sorted order and using union-find to avoid cycles, Kruskal's builds an MST incrementally, with each greedy choice guaranteed correct.
