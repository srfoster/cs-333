question: |
  **Implement and explain B-Trees.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why B-Trees are significant, both practically and theoretically. 
  
  **Level 1** Step through insertions on a B-Tree and demonstrate how splitting works.
  
  **Level 2** Implement B-Tree insertion in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze B-Trees:

  - Height in terms of branching factor: O(log_b n) where b depends on node size
  - Why large branching factors minimize disk I/O (fewer node accesses)
  - Trade-off between disk access cost vs in-node search cost
  - Compare to binary balanced trees (AVL/Red-Black) in terms of disk performance
  - Explain why databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and file systems (NTFS, HFS+) use B-Trees or variants (B+-Trees)
answer: |
  **Defining Properties:**
  - **Multi-way search tree**: Each node holds multiple keys (1 to 2t-1 keys where t is minimum degree)
  - **Sorted keys**: Keys within node are sorted, enabling binary search within node
  - **All leaves at same level**: Guarantees balanced height
  - **Children between keys**: Node with k keys has k+1 children, maintaining search property
  
  **Why B-Trees Matter:**
  The critical insight is **disk I/O cost dominance**. Reading one disk block takes ~10ms (millions of CPU cycles), so minimizing disk accesses is paramount. B-Trees pack many keys per node (matching disk block size, often 4KB-64KB), dramatically reducing tree height.
  
  **Height Analysis:**
  - Height = O(log_b n) where b is branching factor (keys per node)
  - Example: With b=100, one million keys requires only height 3
  - Compare to binary tree: height 20 for one million keys
  - Fewer levels = fewer disk reads = dramatically faster
  
  **Performance Characteristics:**
  - **Disk I/O**: O(log_b n) disk accesses for search/insert/delete
  - **In-node search**: Binary search within node is fast (in-memory)
  - **Trade-off**: Larger nodes reduce height but increase in-node search time (acceptable since in-memory search is cheap)
  
  **Real-World Applications:**
  - **Databases**: MySQL InnoDB, PostgreSQL use B+-Trees (variant where data lives in leaves)
  - **File Systems**: NTFS, HFS+, ext4 use B-Trees for directory indexing
  - **Reason**: Optimal for disk-based storage where minimizing I/O is more important than CPU efficiency
  
  **Key Insight**: B-Trees are engineered for storage hierarchy - they match tree node size to disk block size, making each disk read as valuable as possible. This is why they dominate external storage despite binary trees being simpler.
