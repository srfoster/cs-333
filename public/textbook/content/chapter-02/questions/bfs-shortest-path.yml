question: |
  **Implement BFS to find shortest paths in unweighted graphs.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why BFS naturally finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs and why this property is significant.
  
  **Level 1** For sample graphs, show how BFS computes distances and reconstructs paths. Give pseudocode for path reconstruction.
  
  **Level 2** Implement BFS shortest path in a language of your choice, including path reconstruction.
  
  **Level 3** Prove why BFS finds shortest paths. Explain the limitation to unweighted graphs and how weighted graphs require different algorithms.

answer: |
  **Why BFS Finds Shortest Paths:**
  BFS explores vertices in distance layers (all distance-1 vertices before any distance-2 vertices). When BFS first reaches a vertex, it's via a shortest path. This property makes BFS optimal for unweighted shortest paths.
  
  **Path Reconstruction:**
  Maintain predecessor array during BFS. When visiting vertex u from v, store pred[u] = v. After BFS, reconstruct path by following predecessors backward from target to source, then reverse.
  
  **Limitation:**
  BFS only works for unweighted graphs (all edges have weight 1). For weighted graphs, you need Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford, which consider edge weights when choosing the next vertex to explore.
