question: |
  (a) Explain the divide and conquer strategy and describe its three phases (divide, conquer, combine).
  
  (b) Give two examples of problems well-suited for divide and conquer and explain why.
  
  (c) Consider a divide and conquer algorithm with recurrence T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n). Use the Master Theorem to determine its time complexity and state which case applies.
answer: |
  (a) Divide and conquer breaks a problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, solves them recursively, then combines their solutions:
     - Divide: Split the problem into smaller subproblems
     - Conquer: Recursively solve each subproblem
     - Combine: Merge subproblem solutions into the overall solution
  
  (b) Examples:
     - Merge sort: Naturally splits array in half, sorts independently, merges efficiently
     - Binary search: Halves search space each step by comparing to middle element
     - Both have clear subproblem independence and efficient combine steps
  
  (c) With a=4, b=2, f(n)=n:
     - n^(log_b(a)) = n^(log_2(4)) = n^2
     - f(n) = n = O(n^(2-ε)) for ε=1
     - This is Case 1: T(n) = Θ(n^(log_b(a))) = Θ(n^2)
     
     The recursive work dominates the combining work, resulting in quadratic time complexity.
