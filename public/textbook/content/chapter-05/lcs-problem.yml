question: "Given two sequences, find the longest common subsequence using dynamic programming. Show the DP table and reconstruct the LCS."
answer: "LCS DP: (1) Create table lcs[i][j] = length of LCS of first i chars of X and first j chars of Y. (2) Recurrence: If X[i]=Y[j], lcs[i][j] = 1 + lcs[i-1][j-1]. Else lcs[i][j] = max(lcs[i-1][j], lcs[i][j-1]). (3) Base: lcs[i][0]=lcs[0][j]=0. Example: X='ABCBDAB', Y='BDCABA'. Fill table. lcs[7][6]=4. Reconstruct: Follow arrows from lcs[7][6]. When X[i]=Y[j], include that character and move diagonally. Else move to max neighbor. Result: 'BCBA' or 'BDAB' (multiple LCS possible). Time: O(mn)."
