question: |
  **Implement a greedy solution to the activity selection problem.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why greedy algorithms sometimes produce optimal solutions and why activity selection is a classic example.
  
  **Level 1** For sample activities with start/finish times, demonstrate the greedy algorithm. Give pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement the activity selection greedy algorithm in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Prove why sorting by finish time yields an optimal solution. Explain when greedy algorithms work vs. when they fail.

answer: |
  **Greedy Activity Selection:**
  Sort by finish time, select first activity, then repeatedly select next compatible activity (start ≥ previous finish).
  
  **Why it works:**
  Greedy choice property - selecting the earliest-finishing activity leaves maximum room for remaining activities. No benefit to choosing later-finishing activity in its place.
  
  **Correctness proof:**
  Exchange argument - if optimal solution doesn't include earliest-finishing activity, we can swap it in without decreasing solution size.
  
  **When greedy works:**
  Problems with greedy choice property (locally optimal choice leads to global optimum) and optimal substructure (optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems).
  
  **Time complexity:** O(n log n) for sorting.
