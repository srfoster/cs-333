question: |
  **Implement greedy algorithms for activity selection and fractional knapsack.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why greedy algorithms sometimes produce optimal solutions. Explain the key properties that make a problem suitable for greedy solutions.
  
  **Level 1** For each problem, demonstrate the greedy algorithm with sample inputs and give pseudocode:
  - Activity selection: activities with start/finish times
  - Fractional knapsack: items with weights and values
  
  **Level 2** Implement both greedy algorithms in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Prove correctness for both algorithms. For activity selection, prove why sorting by finish time is optimal. For fractional knapsack, prove why selecting by value-to-weight ratio is optimal. Compare to 0/1 knapsack and explain when greedy approaches fail.

answer: |
  **Activity Selection:**
  Sort by finish time, select first activity, then repeatedly select next compatible activity (start ≥ previous finish).
  
  **Fractional Knapsack:**
  Sort items by value/weight ratio (descending), take items greedily until capacity full (taking fractions as needed).
  
  **Why Greedy Works:**
  Both have greedy choice property - locally optimal choice leads to global optimum. Both have optimal substructure - optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems.
  
  **Activity Selection Proof:**
  Exchange argument - if optimal solution doesn't include earliest-finishing activity, we can swap it in without decreasing solution size. Earliest finish leaves maximum room for remaining activities.
  
  **Fractional Knapsack Proof:**
  Exchange argument - if solution doesn't follow ratio order, swapping portions increases total value. Can always take fractions, so maximize value per unit weight.
  
  **When Greedy Fails:**
  0/1 knapsack lacks greedy choice property. Taking highest-ratio item might use capacity better filled by multiple smaller items. Requires DP to explore combinations. Greedy needs both greedy choice property AND optimal substructure.
  
  **Time complexity:** Both O(n log n) for sorting.
