question: |
  **Reduce SAT to 3-SAT to show 3-SAT is NP-complete.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why reductions are fundamental to complexity theory and what it means for a problem to be NP-complete.
  
  **Level 1** For sample SAT formulas with varied clause sizes, demonstrate the reduction to 3-SAT. Give the transformation rules.
  
  **Level 2** Implement a SAT-to-3SAT reduction in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Prove the reduction is polynomial-time and preserves satisfiability in both directions.

answer: |
  **SAT to 3-SAT Reduction:**
  - 1-literal clause (x): Add dummies → (x ∨ y ∨ ¬y)
  - 2-literal clause (x ∨ y): Add dummy → (x ∨ y ∨ z)
  - 4+ literal clause: Split with auxiliary variables
  
  **Correctness:**
  Forward: If SAT satisfied, set dummies/auxiliaries appropriately
  Backward: If 3-SAT satisfied, original variables satisfy SAT
  
  **Polynomial time:**
  Each clause produces O(k) new clauses where k is clause length. Total O(n×k) where n = number of clauses.
  
  **Significance:**
  Once we know SAT is NP-complete (Cook-Levin), this shows 3-SAT is NP-complete by reduction.
