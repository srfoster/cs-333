question: |
  **Implement a dynamic programming solution to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss the significance of LCS in bioinformatics, version control, and other applications.
  
  **Level 1** For sample sequences, demonstrate the DP table construction and backtracking. Give pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement LCS with DP in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the O(mn) complexity and space. Explain optimal substructure and how to recover the actual subsequence.

answer: |
  **LCS DP:**
  Table lcs[i][j] = length of LCS of first i chars of X and first j chars of Y.
  If X[i]=Y[j]: lcs[i][j] = 1 + lcs[i-1][j-1]
  Else: lcs[i][j] = max(lcs[i-1][j], lcs[i][j-1])
  
  **Optimal substructure:**
  LCS of X[1..i] and Y[1..j] uses LCS of prefixes.
  
  **Reconstruction:**
  Backtrack from lcs[m][n]: when X[i]=Y[j], include character and move diagonally; else move toward max.
  
  **Time:** O(mn), Space: O(mn) (can reduce to O(min(m,n)))
