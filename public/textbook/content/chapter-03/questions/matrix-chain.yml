question: |
  **Implement the matrix chain multiplication optimization algorithm.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why matrix multiplication order matters and the significance of this optimization problem.
  
  **Level 1** For sample matrix dimensions, demonstrate the DP table construction. Give pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement matrix chain ordering with DP in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the O(n³) complexity. Explain optimal substructure and how dramatically the cost varies with parenthesization.

answer: |
  **Matrix Chain DP:**
  Table m[i][j] = min scalar multiplications for Ai...Aj.
  Recurrence: m[i][j] = min(m[i][k] + m[k+1][j] + pi-1×pk×pj) for all k between i and j.
  
  **Why it matters:**
  Different orders have dramatically different costs. (A×B)×C vs A×(B×C) can differ by orders of magnitude.
  
  **Optimal substructure:**
  Optimal parenthesization of Ai...Aj splits at some k, with optimal solutions on both sides.
  
  **Time:** O(n³) - must try all split points for all subchains.
