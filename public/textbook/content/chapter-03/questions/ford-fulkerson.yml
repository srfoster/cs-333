chapter: 3
question: |
  **Implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (maximum flow problem).**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss what a maximum flow problem is, and give a few examples.  Explain the significance of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and an informal discussion of the max-flow min-cut theorem.
  
  **Level 1** For sample flow networks, demonstrate finding augmenting paths and updating flow. Give pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement Ford-Fulkerson in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the complexity. Explain augmenting paths, residual networks, and why the algorithm terminates with integer capacities.  (Bonus: Give a more formal proof of the max-flow min-cut theorem.)

answer: |
  **Ford-Fulkerson:**
  Repeatedly find augmenting paths (source to sink with residual capacity), push flow along path, update residual graph. Terminates when no augmenting path exists.
  
  **Residual network:**
  For each edge with flow f < capacity c, residual has forward edge (capacity c-f) and backward edge (capacity f).
  
  **Complexity:**
  O(E × max_flow) - can be slow if capacities are large. Edmonds-Karp (BFS for paths) gives O(VE²).
  
  **Applications:**
  Network routing, bipartite matching, airline scheduling, image segmentation.
