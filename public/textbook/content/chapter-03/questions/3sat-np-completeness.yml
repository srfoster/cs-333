question: |
  **Prove that 3-SAT is NP-complete.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why 3-SAT is a canonical NP-complete problem and its importance in complexity theory.
  
  **Level 1** Outline the proof structure: showing 3-SAT is in NP, and showing it's NP-hard via reduction from SAT.
  
  **Level 2** Implement a 3-SAT verifier (polynomial-time algorithm that checks if a given assignment satisfies the formula).
  
  **Level 3** Complete the full proof. Explain the significance of NP-completeness for understanding computational hardness.

answer: |
  **Proof that 3-SAT is NP-complete:**
  
  **(1) 3-SAT ∈ NP:**
  Certificate is a variable assignment. Verification checks each clause has ≥1 true literal. O(n×m) time where n = variables, m = clauses.
  
  **(2) 3-SAT is NP-hard:**
  Reduce SAT to 3-SAT (polynomial time). Since SAT is NP-complete (Cook-Levin), 3-SAT is NP-hard.
  
  **Significance:**
  3-SAT is simpler than general SAT (uniform 3 literals per clause) yet still NP-complete. Many other problems reduce from 3-SAT (graph coloring, clique, vertex cover). If P≠NP, no polynomial algorithm exists for 3-SAT.
