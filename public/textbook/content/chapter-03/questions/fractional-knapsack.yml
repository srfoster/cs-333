question: |
  **Implement the fractional knapsack greedy algorithm.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss the difference between fractional and 0/1 knapsack and why one admits a greedy solution while the other doesn't.
  
  **Level 1** For sample items with weights and values, demonstrate the greedy algorithm. Give pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement the fractional knapsack algorithm in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Prove why the greedy approach (selecting by value-to-weight ratio) is optimal. Compare to 0/1 knapsack and explain why it requires dynamic programming.

answer: |
  **Fractional Knapsack Greedy:**
  Sort items by value/weight ratio (descending), take items greedily until capacity full (taking fractions of items as needed).
  
  **Why greedy works:**
  Can take fractions, so always maximize value per unit weight. No reason to take lower-ratio item before higher-ratio item.
  
  **Optimality proof:**
  Exchange argument - if solution doesn't follow ratio order, swapping portions increases total value.
  
  **vs. 0/1 Knapsack:**
  0/1 (can't take fractions) lacks greedy choice property. Taking highest-ratio item might use capacity that could fit multiple smaller high-value items. Requires DP to explore combinations.
  
  **Time complexity:** O(n log n) for sorting.
