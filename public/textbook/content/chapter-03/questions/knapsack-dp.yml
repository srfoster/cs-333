chapter: 3
question: |
  **Implement a dynamic programming solution to the 0/1 knapsack problem.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why DP is needed for 0/1 knapsack and what problems exhibit optimal substructure.
  
  **Level 1** For sample items and capacity, demonstrate the DP table construction. Give pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement 0/1 knapsack with DP in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the O(nW) complexity. Explain why this is pseudo-polynomial and compare to fractional knapsack.

answer: |
  **0/1 Knapsack DP:**
  Table dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w.
  Recurrence: dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], value[i] + dp[i-1][w-weight[i]])
  
  **Optimal substructure:**
  Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems (with/without item i).
  
  **Time:** O(nW) - pseudo-polynomial (exponential in input size since W is exponential in bits needed to represent it).
  
  **vs. Fractional:**
  Fractional: O(n log n) greedy. 0/1: must consider combinations, no greedy choice property.
