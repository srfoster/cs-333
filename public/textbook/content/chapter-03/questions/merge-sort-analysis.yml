  Analyze merge sort using the divide and conquer strategy:
  
  (a) Describe how merge sort divides the problem and merges solutions.
  
  (b) Write the recurrence relation T(n) for merge sort's time complexity.
  
  (c) Apply the Master Theorem to solve this recurrence. State which case applies and explain why.
answer: |
  (a) Merge sort divides the array into two equal halves, recursively sorts each half, then merges the two sorted halves in linear time. The base case is an array of size 1 (already sorted).
  
  (b) T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
     - 2T(n/2): Two recursive calls on half-sized problems
     - O(n): Linear time to merge two sorted halves
  
  (c) Using Master Theorem with a=2, b=2, f(n)=n:
     - n^(log_b(a)) = n^(log_2(2)) = n^1 = n
     - f(n) = n = Θ(n^(log_b(a)))
     - This is Case 2: T(n) = Θ(n^(log_b(a)) log n) = Θ(n log n)
     
     Merge sort has Θ(n log n) time complexity in all cases (best, average, worst).
