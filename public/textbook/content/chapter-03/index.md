# Chapter 3: Recursion, Trees, and Graphs

This chapter explores recursive algorithms and the hierarchical and networked data structures that naturally support them.

## Recursion

Recursion is a powerful problem-solving technique where functions call themselves. You'll learn:

* How recursion relates to iteration
* Writing and solving recurrence relations
* Analyzing recursive algorithms (including the Fibonacci sequence)
* Optimization techniques like memoization

## Tree Data Structures

Trees provide hierarchical organization with efficient search and modification. We'll compare:

* **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**: Simple but potentially unbalanced
* **AVL Trees**: Strict balance guarantees faster lookups
* **Red-Black Trees**: Looser balance, fewer rotations
* **B-Trees**: Multi-way trees optimized for disk access

## Graph Algorithms

Graphs model relationships and networks. You'll master:

* **Representation**: Adjacency matrices vs. adjacency lists
* **Traversal**: BFS and DFS for exploring graphs
* **Shortest Paths**: BFS for unweighted graphs, Dijkstra for weighted
* **Minimum Spanning Trees**: Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms

## Key Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Write and analyze recursive algorithms
* Solve recurrence relations using multiple techniques
* Choose appropriate tree structures for different applications
* Implement BFS and DFS traversal algorithms
* Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths
* Use Prim's or Kruskal's to find minimum spanning trees
* Prove correctness of greedy graph algorithms
