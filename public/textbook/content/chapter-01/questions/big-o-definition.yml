  **Level 0 - Big Picture:**
  This problem demonstrates a fundamental concept in computer science: there can be multiple algorithms with drastically different performance characteristics for the same problem. The iterative solution (loop) runs in O(n) time, while the mathematical formula (using n(n+1)/2) runs in O(1) time. This illustrates why algorithmic thinking and mathematical insight matter.

  **Level 1 - Intuition and Pseudocode:**
  
  *Approach 1: Iterative (Loop)*
  ```
  FUNCTION sumToN(n):
      sum = 0
      FOR i = 1 TO n DO
          sum = sum + i
      RETURN sum
  ```
  Example: sumToN(5) = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
  
  *Approach 2: Mathematical Formula*
  ```
  FUNCTION sumToN(n):
      RETURN n * (n + 1) / 2
  ```
  Example: sumToN(5) = 5 * 6 / 2 = 15

  **Level 2 - Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Iterative approach
  def sum_to_n_iterative(n):
      total = 0
      for i in range(1, n + 1):
          total += i
      return total
  
  # Formula approach
  def sum_to_n_formula(n):
      return n * (n + 1) // 2
  ```

  **Level 3 - Complexity Analysis:**
  
  *Iterative Solution:*
  - Time: O(n) - must execute n iterations
  - Space: O(1) - only stores sum variable
  
  *Formula Solution:*
  - Time: O(1) - constant time regardless of n
  - Space: O(1) - only stores result
  
  The formula approach is dramatically more efficient. This problem highlights that understanding the mathematical properties of a problem can lead to optimal solutions. The formula (derived by Gauss as a child) transforms an O(n) problem into O(1).

  This problem exemplifies the power of closed-form solutions in computational complexity. The iterative approach requires Θ(n) operations, executing exactly n additions and n-1 loop iterations. The arithmetic series formula n(n+1)/2 reduces this to Θ(1) through mathematical insight.
  
  The closed-form solution demonstrates that algorithmic complexity isn't just about optimizing code - it's about recognizing mathematical structure. This connects to:
  - Recurrence relations: T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) for iterative approach
  - Summation formulas: Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ i = n(n+1)/2
  - Space-time tradeoffs: Both use O(1) space, but time differs by a factor of n
  
  In practice, modern compilers might optimize the loop, but the mathematical formula guarantees O(1) performance regardless of compiler optimizations.
