  Give an overview of this course in terms of the data structures and algorithms covered.
  
  **Data structures** From simplest (datums) to most complex (graphs).
  
  **Algorithms** From O(1) to O(2^n) complexity.
answer: |
  This course progresses through fundamental data structures and algorithms in order of increasing complexity:
  
  **Data Structures (Simple → Complex):**
  - **Datums**: Individual values (integers, strings, booleans)
  - **Tuples**: Fixed-size ordered collections of datums
  - **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections with O(1) random access
  - **Lists**: Dynamic collections (linked lists, array lists)
  - **Trees**: Hierarchical structures (BST, AVL, B-Trees) enabling O(log n) operations
  - **Graphs**: Networks of nodes and edges representing relationships
  
  **Algorithms by Complexity:**
  - **O(1)**: Array access, hash table lookup
  - **O(log n)**: Binary search, balanced tree operations
  - **O(n)**: Linear search, array traversal, tree traversal
  - **O(n log n)**: Efficient sorting (merge sort, quicksort)
  - **O(n²)**: Simple sorting (selection, insertion), nested loops
  - **O(2ⁿ)**: Exponential algorithms (naive recursion, subset generation)
  
  The course builds from analyzing simple operations to understanding complex graph algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and minimum spanning trees.
