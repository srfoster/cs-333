question: |
  Explain the following common iteration patterns with Python examples:
  
  (a) The Accumulator Pattern
  
  (b) The Transformation (Map) Pattern
  
  (c) Explain the key difference between these two patterns.
answer: |
  (a) **Accumulator Pattern**: Builds up a single result by iterating through a collection. Example:
  ```python
  # Sum all numbers in a list
  def sum_list(numbers):
      total = 0  # accumulator
      for num in numbers:
          total += num
      return total
  ```
  The accumulator (total) starts with an initial value and is updated in each iteration, finally returning a single aggregated result.
  
  (b) **Transformation (Map) Pattern**: Creates a new collection by applying a transformation to each element. Example:
  ```python
  # Square all numbers in a list
  def square_list(numbers):
      result = []  # new collection
      for num in numbers:
          result.append(num ** 2)
      return result
  ```
  Each element is transformed and added to a new collection, maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between input and output.
  
  (c) **Key Difference**: The accumulator pattern reduces a collection to a single value (e.g., sum, product, max), while the transformation pattern produces a new collection of the same size with each element transformed. Accumulator combines elements; transformation applies a function to each element independently.
