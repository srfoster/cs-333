question: |
  **Write an algorithm that searches for a target value in an unsorted array.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss the big-picture significance of this problem and how it relates to Big-O (O), Big-Omega (Ω), and Big-Theta (Θ) notation.
  
  **Level 1** Discuss the intuition behind this problem by giving example inputs (including best case and worst case scenarios); give the pseudocode for a linear search algorithm and step through it.
  
  **Level 2** Implement your algorithm in a language of your choice.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexity using Ω, O, and Θ notation. Explain why this algorithm demonstrates the difference between these three notations.
answer: |
  **Linear Search Analysis:**
  - Best case: Ω(1) - target found at first position
  - Worst case: O(n) - target at last position or not found
  - Average case: Θ(n) - on average, check half the array
  
  This algorithm demonstrates how Ω (lower bound) and O (upper bound) can differ significantly. The best case is dramatically better than the worst case, showing that Big-O and Big-Omega describe different scenarios. The average case is Θ(n) because we expect to examine roughly n/2 elements on average, which is still linear growth.
