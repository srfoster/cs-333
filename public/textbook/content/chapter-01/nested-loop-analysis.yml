  Consider the following code:

  ```python
  i = 1
  while i < n:
      j = 0
      while j < i:
          print(j)
          j += 1
      i *= 2
  ```

  (a) Count how many times the inner loop executes as a function of n.
  
  (b) Give a tight Θ bound and justify your answer.
answer: "(a) The outer loop runs log₂(n) times since i doubles each iteration. In iteration k, i = 2^k and the inner loop runs 2^k times. Total executions: Σ(k=0 to log₂(n)-1) 2^k = 2^(log₂(n)) - 1 = n - 1. (b) Θ(n). The sum of the geometric series 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + n/2 equals n-1, which is Θ(n)."
