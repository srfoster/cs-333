  **Level 3** Prove the max-flow min-cut theorem. Explain applications in network reliability and security.

answer: |
  **Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem:**
  Maximum flow value equals minimum cut capacity. A cut is a partition of vertices into sets S (containing source) and T (containing sink).
  
  **Proof sketch:**
  (1) Flow ≤ any cut capacity (flow conservation)
  (2) When Ford-Fulkerson terminates, no augmenting path exists
  (3) S = vertices reachable from source in residual graph
  (4) Cut (S,T) has no residual capacity, so flow = cut capacity
  
  **Finding min cut:**
  After max flow, cut consists of edges from S to T where S = BFS-reachable vertices in residual graph.
  
  **Applications:**
  Network reliability (min cut = vulnerability), image segmentation, social network analysis.
