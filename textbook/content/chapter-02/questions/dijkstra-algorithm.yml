question: |
  **Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths in weighted graphs.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss why Dijkstra's algorithm is significant and how it extends BFS to handle weighted graphs.
  
  **Level 1** For sample weighted graphs, demonstrate Dijkstra's algorithm showing the priority queue and distance updates. Give pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement Dijkstra's algorithm in a language of your choice, including path reconstruction.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the time complexity with different priority queue implementations. Explain why negative edge weights break the algorithm and what alternatives exist.
answer: |
  **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
  Uses a priority queue to always process the vertex with minimum distance. Maintains distances and predecessors like BFS, but updates distances when shorter paths are found.
  
  **Time Complexity:**
  - Binary heap: O((V+E) log V) - best for sparse graphs
  - Simple array: O(V²) - competitive for dense graphs
  - Fibonacci heap: O(E + V log V) - theoretically optimal
  
  **Negative Edge Limitation:**
  Dijkstra assumes once a vertex is finalized (extracted from priority queue), its distance is optimal. Negative edges can create shorter paths through "already finalized" vertices, breaking this assumption. For negative edges, use Bellman-Ford (O(VE)) or detect negative cycles.
  
  **Significance:**
  Dijkstra extends BFS's shortest path finding to weighted graphs, enabling GPS routing, network packet routing, and any system where connections have varying costs.
